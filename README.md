# Gonoku
## 1. Introduction
Gonoku is a game that is similar to Gomoku. The game is played on a 15x15 board. The first player to get 5 stones in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) wins the game. The game is played by two players, one player uses black stones and the other player uses white stones. The players take turns placing stones on the board. The game ends when one player wins or the board is full. If the board is full and neither player has 5 stones in a row, the game is a draw.

## 2. How to play
### 2.1. Start the game
To start the game, run the following command in the terminal:
```
pip install pygame
python3 gonoku.py
```
### 2.2. Play the game
I made a simple gonoku implementation using **Pygame**. Instead of using stones, I used *X* and *O* marks. Run the file and press on the cell you want to place your mark in. Player *X* always starts first. The game ends when one player wins or the board is full. The game ends when either player has 5 in a row. (Horizontally, Vertically or Diagonally). Press ***R*** on your keyboard to restart mid-game. When game is completed press Left click to restart.
